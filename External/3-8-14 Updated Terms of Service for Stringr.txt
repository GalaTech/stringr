STRINGR TERMS OF SERVICE
1.  Well hello there
Thank you for visiting Stringr and, if applicable, choosing to download and install our awesome App.  Please read these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy carefully as you must agree to both in order to have permission to use our Service.  Also, it’s good practice because some people out there use these documents to get you to agree to $1000/month rebills to have pictures of hamsters sent to your phone, so we always encourage reading online agreements.

2.  Definitions
We know that you’re college edu-ma-cated and you’re probably very smart, but some of the words that we use might have a different or broader meaning than in real life, so here are a few words we think might be useful to define:
“Agreement” refers to these Terms of Service;
“App” refers to our mobile software application which provides Stringr through iOS platforms;
“Stringr” is not a typo for “stringer,” which if you didn’t know is a freelance journalist, but instead refers to our company, known as “Stringr, LLC”; our Site; our App; our Service; or a combination of all or some of the preceding definitions, depending on the context in which the word is used;
“Service” refers to the services that we provide, including our App and our Site;
“Site” refers to our website, www.stringrapp.com;
“User” refers to anyone who uses our Service, including anyone who uses our App and general visitors to our Site;
“You” as in, “Hey, you!” refers to you, the person who is entering into this Agreement with Stringr.

3.  What Stringr offers
Stringr is a unique photo-sharing application and social network designed and built for exclusive use by college and university students.  Student status will be verified via Facebook.  Each user who has not already done so must first join his/her respective school’s official Facebook group page using his/her school-issued e-mail address.  Otherwise, they will not be able to use the Service and our bouncer will politely show them the door.
The Stringr network is largely based around the concept of a “String.”  A String has similar properties to a photo album, but is displayed in a significantly more fluid and fun way.  There are many features contained in the Stringr network, including but not limited to:
	•	Building and publishing new strings
	•	Following other users
	•	Discovering strings/other users
	•	Viewing strings and photos
	•	Inviting friends
	•	User profiles
	•	Likes and comments
	•	Sharing to other social networks
	•	Inter-dimensional space travel (this one is still in development)
Whether you are beret-wearing hipsters taking pictures of exotic food and art that nobody understands, or ‘roided up beefcakes showing how much you can lift in the college gym, Stringr offers a great new medium for photo sharing.

4.  You must be at least this tall to ride
In order to use our Service, you must meet a number of conditions, including but not limited to:
	•	You must not be in violation of any embargoes, export controls, or other laws of the United States or other countries having jurisdiction over this Agreement, Stringr, LLC, and yourself.  For example, if the Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibits conducting financial transactions with nationals, residents, or banks of your country, you must not use our Service.  We don’t know how a photo sharing service could possibly have any bearing on ICBMs or human rights abuses but we weren’t dumb enough to qualify for public office so we had no say when the rules were being made.
	•	You must not have previously created any other account with Stringr unless you receive prior permission from Stringr to create an additional account.  This applies even if you’re so smart that you’re enrolled in two schools at once and have two e-mail IDs that you could potentially use to sign up for our Service—please still contact us first.
	•	You must be the minimum age required to enter into a contract in the area in which you reside, and, in any event, must not be less than 18 years of age.  We know, you’re allowed to drive, go to college, and join the army with permission at 17 but for some reason you can’t be bound by an Internet contract so we have to make this rule.
	•	You must provide us with personal information and other information that we deem necessary to provide you with our Service.
	•	You must be a current college or university student and you must use Stringr in association with the college or university in which you are enrolled.  The college must be a legitimate one, too—please no applicants from Hawvord, Kornell, or Prinstun.

5.  Not our bad
Stringr, LLC is not responsible for any of the content shared through our Service, nor do we make any representations about the efficacy (fancy legal word for “usefulness”) of our Service.  You agree that you are solely responsible for determining whether you should use our Service, and you agree to hold Stringr harmless for any liability that it might otherwise have to you in the context of our provision of our Service to you or the actions of any other User.  To summarize:  If you have never been grossed out or offended by a picture on the Internet, you have not used the Internet.  We don’t post any of the pictures here so it’s not “our bad.”

6.  Rules of the game
We require that you follow certain rules to minimize hair pulling among our Users and visits to our headquarters by angry law enforcement officers.  You must not:
	•	Violate the laws of the United States, its states, the Planet Neptune, or any foreign political entity having jurisdiction over this Agreement, whether or not the foreign political entity is a country or a subdivision (such as a state or province) or municipality (such as a city, town, county, or region) of a foreign country.
	•	Post or send anything violent, threatening, pornographic, racist, hateful, totally lame, or otherwise objectionable according to the opinion of Stringr.
	•	Infringe on anyone’s intellectual property rights, defame anyone, impersonate anyone, or otherwise violate the rights of a third party.  Remember, “Happy Birthday” is still somehow copyrighted, so please don’t post it lest a music syndicate (which shall remain unnamed) be jerks about it and send us a takedown notice.
	•	Hack, crack, phish, ice fish, SQL inject, Botox inject, or otherwise compromise the security or integrity of the Stringr Site, Service, or its Users’ computers.
	•	Do anything else which could bring Stringr, LLC into disrepute or violate the rights of any person.
Stringr, LLC reserves the right to block, edit, or delete—with extreme Judge Dredd-style prejudice—any content which violates the above provisions without notification.

7.  Our copyright
Our content is important to us because it helps distinguish us from third parties, whether they are our competitors or are gluten-free recipe websites that somehow happen to rank for similar keywords to our photo-sharing website in search engines.  You agree not to copy, distribute, display, disseminate, or otherwise reproduce any of the information on the Site, including content submitted by third parties (such as other Users) to Stringr, without receiving our prior written permission or the necessary authorization from the relevant third party.

8.  Your copyright
Stringr, LLC must be assured that it has the right to use the content that is posted to its Site by its Users.  Such content may include, but is not limited to, photographs, videos, text, audio, Morse code, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, and other materials.  Whenever submitting content to our website, you agree that you are granting us a non-exclusive, universal, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, commercial and non-commercial right to use, distribute, sell, publish, and otherwise make use of the content that you submit to us to the extent that is reasonably necessary to provide you with our Service, transfer our Service to a third party in the case of sale or other business structure change, or secure out Service.  You warrant to us that you have the right to grant us this right over the content, and that you will indemnify us for any loss resulting from a breach of this warranty and defend us against claims regarding the same.

9.  Trademarks
“Stringr” is a mark used by us, Stringr, LLC, to uniquely identify our Site, Service, and business.  You agree not to use this or similar phrases anywhere without our prior written consent or that of two thirds of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Additionally, you agree not to use our trade dress, or copy the look and feel of our Site or its design, without our prior written consent.  You agree that this paragraph goes beyond the governing law on intellectual property law, and includes prohibitions on any competition that violates the provisions of this paragraph, including starting your own competing business.  If you start up a photo-sharing service called “Stringr” we will become suspicious.

10.  Revocation of consent
We may revoke our consent for your use of our intellectual property, or any other permission granted to you under this Agreement, at any time—in the legal field, this is known as “takesies backsies.”  You agree that if we so request, you must take immediate action to remove any usage of our intellectual property that you may have engaged in, even if it would cause a loss to you.

11.  Don’t steal other people’s stuff
We take copyright infringement very seriously—in fact, a copyright saved our lives in ‘nam.  Accordingly, we have registered a Copyright Agent with the United States Copyright Office, which limits our liability under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please calm down and dry your tears and send us a message which contains:

	•	Your name.
	•	The name of the party whose copyright has been infringed, if different from your name.
	•	The name and description of the work that is being infringed.
	•	The location on our website of the infringing copy.
	•	A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted work described above is not authorized by the copyright owner (or by a third party who is legally entitled to do so on behalf of the copyright owner) and is not otherwise permitted by law.
	•	A statement that you swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in this notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or have an exclusive right in law to bring infringement proceedings with respect to its use.
You must sign this notification electronically and send it to our Copyright Agent at stringragent@gmail.com.

Although U.S. law does not provide for a similar procedure for trademark infringement, we recommend that you send us similar information to that above in regards to any allegation of trademark infringement, and we will address it as soon as practicable because we’d rather can the offender than pay hefty legal fees.

12.  Nasty words
Similar to the DMCA provisions above, United States law—specifically Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act—creates a defense for us for the actions of third parties in regards to any defamatory content posted on our Site or otherwise through our Service.  Although we are not liable for defamatory words published by our Users even if given notice, we do prohibit defamation under this Agreement and we may, if we believe the situation warrants it, take action against the offending User.  Please notify us at stringrguys@gmail.com if any of our Users have posted anything that you believe is false and downright mean.

13.  Representations and warranties
A LONG TIME AGO, SOME DUDE IN A POWDERED WIG AND A BLACK ROBE DECIDED IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO TYPE THIS SECTION LIKE HE WAS YELLING, SO NOW LAWYERS DO IT OUT OF TRADITION.  WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE SHOULD ACT LIKE WE’RE ALL ANGRY-LIKE IN THIS SECTION BY WRITING IN ALL CAPS BUT WE DON’T WANT TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN SO WE’LL JUST DEAL WITH IT.

WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE MERCHANTABILITY OF OUR SERVICE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES, FOR REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF OUR SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER TORT.  TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM EXISTS.

YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY USE OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO COMMIT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, DEFAMATION, TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC RELATIONS, OR ANY OTHER ACTIONABLE CONDUCT TOWARDS YOU.

WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES OF OUR COMPANY OR A THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS, UNTIMELY DELIVERY, SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED, INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL, ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY.

THE PROVISION OF OUR SERVICE TO YOU IS CONTINGENT ON YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  NOTHING IN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS “REPRESENTATIONS & WARRANTIES” SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE GENERALITY OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION.

For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability: Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.  Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."  YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE.  YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.
OKAY, WE CAN STOP YELLING NOW.

14.  Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims by you or any third party which may arise from or relate to this Agreement or the provision of our service to you, including any damages caused by your use of our Site or Service or acceptance of the offers published on our Site.  You also agree that you have a duty to defend us against such claims and we may require you to pay for an attorney(s) of our choice in such cases.  You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements.  In the event of a claim such as one described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making the claim, and you shall be liable for the damages as though we had proceeded with a trial.  Please, don’t do something that makes defending a lawsuit against us the legal equivalent of trying to save the Hindenburg or we’ll just throw in the towel and call it a day.

15.  Choice of law
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the State of Oklahoma.  The offer and acceptance of this contract are deemed to have occurred in the State of Oklahoma.  A Broadway musical was called Oklahoma!  For more information about Oklahoma, contact your local Oklahomologist.

16.  No gunfights
Since the passage of the Judicial Modernization Act of 2012 by the Oklahoma State Legislature, gunfights at dawn are no longer an accepted form of dispute resolution in the State of Oklahoma.  You therefore agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Oklahoma.  Specifically, where the subject matter of a dispute is eligible for it, you agree that any disputes shall be heard solely according to the Small Claims Procedure before a District Court in the State of Oklahoma (“Small Claims Court”).
If a dispute claims multiple claims and one or more of those claims would be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, you agree not to bring the other claims against us and to instead proceed within the Small Claims Court.
If you would be entitled in a dispute to an amount exceeding the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, you agree to waive your right to collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead still bring your claim within the Small Claims Court.
You agree that if a dispute is eligible to be heard in Small Claims Court but you would be entitled to an additional or alternative remedy in a higher court, such as injunctive relief, you will waive your right to that remedy and still bring the dispute within the Small Claims Court.
If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.
You agree that the unsuccessful party in any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be responsible for the reimbursement of the successful party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements.

17.  Force majeure
You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, zombie attacks, crime, cattle stampedes, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, sentient robot insurrections, communication disruption, unavailability of payment processors, failure or shortage of infrastructure, Martian invasions, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.

18.  Severability
In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.
If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, Stringr, LLC shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.  We may make our decision with a high stakes game of checkers or we may simply choose which provision we like best.

19.  What’d you say about our mama?
Stringr, LLC reserves all rights afforded to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law.  Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.  Don’t think that because Bill said our mother wears army boots, we’ll let Bob get away with it without us suing for defamation.  She wears paratrooper boots, thank you very much.

20.  Termination and cancellation
We may terminate your access to our Site and Service at our discretion without explanation, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases.  Our liability for refunding you, if you have paid anything to us, will be limited to the amount you paid for goods or services which have not yet been and will not be delivered, except in cases where the termination or cancellation was due to your breach of this Agreement, in which case you agree that we are not required to provide any refund or other compensation whatsoever.
Under no circumstances, including termination or cancellation of our Service to you, will we be liable for any losses related to actions of other Users, even if it turns out that someone warned us they were a crazy chainsaw murderer with rabies and we didn’t do anything about it.

21.  Assignment of rights
You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent.  We may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our discretion.  It is unlikely that we will do this because we think Stringr is awesome and we don’t want to part with it.

22.  Changing things up
We may amend this Agreement from time to time.  When we amend this Agreement, we will require you to read, agree to, and accept all changes before accessing our Service.  Additionally, you must read this Agreement each time you use our Service, and your continued use of our Service shall also constitute your acceptance of any such amendments.  We’re not going to take out a second mortgage on your house or anything but you should still read these Terms of Service because it’s good practice.

23.  California peepz
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1789.3, any questions about pricing, complaints, or inquiries about Stringr must be addressed to our agent for notice and sent via certified mail to that agent.  For our agent’s most current contact information, please send a request to stringrguys@gmail.com.
Lastly, California users are also entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.
