STRINGR PRIVACY POLICY
1.  Hi again
You’ve read our Terms of Service, right?  No?  Okay, go do that real quick and we’ll play ping pong while we wait.  Alright, you’re back.  Let’s discuss your privacy.
2.  Déjà vu
Remember this?  Of course you do, because you’ve already read our Terms of Service.  This is what fancy words we use mean:
“App” refers to our mobile software application which provides Stringr through iOS platforms;
“Stringr” is not a typo for “stringer,” which if you didn’t know is a freelance journalist, but instead refers to our company, known as “Stringr, LLC”; our Site; our App; our Service; or a combination of all or some of the preceding definitions, depending on the context in which the word is used;
“Service” refers to the services that we provide, including our App and our Site;
“Site” refers to our website, www.stringrapp.com;
“User” refers to anyone who uses our Service, including anyone who uses our App and general visitors to our Site;
“You” as in, “Hey, you!” refers to you, the person who is governed by this Privacy Policy.

Identifying Information
We collect certain personal information from you when you sign up to our Service that can be used to identify you, such as your name, unique device identification number, and exact coordinates if our Predator drones can spot you.  Additionally, we use Facebook to obtain your information and establish your Stringr account.  The information we collect from you, to the extent that it is private, is disclosed only in accordance with our Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy.
Non-Identifying Information
Whenever you visit our Site, we may collect non-identifying information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, blood type, DNA, and Internet Service Provider.  Without a subpoena, voluntary compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, additional records from a third party, or those creepy clairvoyants from Minority Report, this information alone cannot usually be used to identify you.
4.  How we use the intel
We may use your information to:
	•	Enhance or improve User experience, our Site, or our Service.
	•	Send e-mails about our Site or respond to inquiries.
	•	Send e-mails and updates about Stringr, including e-mail newsletters.
	•	Verify your student status using your Facebook account.
	•	Print off and make into funny paper hats (we will shred them after to protect your information).
	•	Perform any other function that we believe in good faith is necessary to protect the security or proper functioning of our Site or Service.
5.  Accessing, Editing, and Removing Your Information
Users may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal information they have provided to us by logging into their account on the Site and editing their account details.  Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser’s cache.  We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such.  In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.  Basically, what we’re trying to say is that the Internet is too big a place to guarantee that we can delete something you want deleted, so you shouldn’t post anything you wouldn’t want your mom to see.
6.  Cookies (Yum)
We use cookies to save your preferences and your photo cache, and to eat with milk for a delicious source of carbohydrates.  For these reasons, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser, and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you consent to our use of cookies in relation to your computer system.
7.  Third Parties
7.1  Third Party Websites
Stringr, LLC may post links to third party websites on its Site.  These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by Stringr, and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.
Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site.  Stringr, LLC bears no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website.  Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit through third party links.  If the website you end up at is written in a strange alphabet, asks for your credit card information, and refers to Glorious Leader Vladimir Putin, you may wish to proceed with caution.
7.2  Third Party Account Services
Stringr uses your Facebook (slayer of Myspace) account to register for your Stringr account.  If you wish to limit what Facebook shares with us, you must adjust your privacy settings for your Facebook account accordingly.
8.  Third Party Access to Your Information
Although you are entering into an Agreement with Stringr, LLC to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.
Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information.  For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our website.
It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy Policy.  For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or systems.  You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
9.  The Five-O
At times it may become necessary or desirable to Stringr, LLC, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency (more likely the cops than the Department of Agriculture, but we’d be impressed if a cow sued you) or a private litigant.  You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter.  In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either.  We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities or have otherwise been a big doo-doo head.  You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.
10.  Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications
By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited e-mails from Stringr, LLC since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us or anyone else covered under this Privacy Policy, including those cool Emperor Palpatine hologram thingies.  However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying Stringr that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.
11.  Zombie timber wolves
We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Site and Service, including using SSL certificates and zombie timber wolves chained to our server hardware.  However, we make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information.  It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats.
12.  California hippies
Stringr, LLC permits residents of California, who are a bunch of surfing hippies, to use its Service.  Therefore, it is the intent of Stringr to comply with the California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579.  If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the Californian privacy statutes.  In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors.  You may contact us at stringrguys@gmail.com with any questions or general paranoid rants about aliens.
13.  Internet?  International
Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Stringr, LLC transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there worse than Soylent Green.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
14.  Amendments
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will update this page accordingly and place the date that it was last modified on it.  You must read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Service, and your continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of any such amendments.
